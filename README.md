## Development Process

### Step 1: Develop the HTML

#### Action-Based To-Do's
1. **Set up the structure:**
   - Create an `index.html` file and add a basic HTML5 boilerplate.
   - Add `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` tags.
   - Include `<section>` elements for About, Projects, and Contact sections.

2. **Add content for each section:**
   - **About Section:**
     - Write a brief introduction inside a `<p>` tag.
     - List technical skills using `<ul>` or `<dl>` for organization.
   - **Projects Section:**
     - Add a grid or list with `<article>` elements for each project.
     - Include `<img>` for project thumbnails, `<h3>` for titles, `<p>` for descriptions, and `<a>` for links to live demos/repositories.
   - **Contact Section:**
     - Use a `<form>` element with `<input>` fields for name and email, a `<textarea>` for messages, and a `<button>` for submission.
     - Add clickable icons (e.g., `<a>` wrapping `<i>` or `<svg>`) for social media.

3. **Ensure accessibility:**
   - Add `alt` attributes for all images.
   - Label form fields using `<label>` elements or `aria-label`.

#### Success Criteria
- The page has all necessary sections and content structured semantically.
- All images include descriptive `alt` text.
- Navigation links work and jump to the correct section when clicked.

### Step 2: Style with CSS

#### Action-Based To-Do's
1. **Set up a responsive layout:**
   - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to position header, main sections, and footer.
   - Write media queries for breakpoints (e.g., mobile-first design).
     - Define a single-column layout for small screens.
     - Switch to a multi-column layout for larger screens.

2. **Apply visual design:**
   - Define CSS variables for colors and typography.
   - Style headings, paragraphs, and lists for readability.
   - Add hover effects to buttons and links with `:hover` and `:focus` pseudo-classes.

3. **Enhance accessibility and readability:**
   - Test color contrast using online tools (e.g., WCAG contrast checker).
   - Add consistent padding/margin for uniform spacing.
   - Use `rem` units for scalable typography.

4. **Optional Animations:**
   - Use `transition` for smooth hover effects.
   - Add `scroll-behavior: smooth;` to the `html` tag for smooth scrolling.

#### Success Criteria
- The website looks visually appealing and organized on desktop and mobile devices.
- Navigation and buttons respond to hover and focus states.
- Spacing and typography are consistent across all sections.
- Animations enhance the experience without being distracting.

### Step 3: Add JavaScript Functionality

#### Action-Based To-Do's
1. **Must-Have Features:**
   - **Navigation Scrolling:**
     - Add `id` attributes to section headers (e.g., `id="about"`) for anchor points.
     - Add `eventListeners` to navigation links for smooth scrolling using JavaScript's `scrollIntoView` method.
   - **Form Validation:**
     - Check for empty fields and validate the email field with a regular expression.
     - Show error messages below invalid inputs.

2. **Should-Have Features:**
   - **Dynamic Project Cards:**
     - Create a `projects.json` file containing project data (title, description, image, links).
     - Fetch the data using `fetch()` and dynamically create project cards using `document.createElement()`.

   - **Sticky Header:**
     - Use CSS `position: sticky` or JavaScript to make the header stick to the top when scrolling.

3. **Can-Have Features:**
   - **Dark Mode Toggle:**
     - Add a toggle button in the header.
     - Use JavaScript to toggle a `dark-mode` class on the `<body>` element.
     - Save the userâ€™s preference in `localStorage`.

   - **Interactive Animations:**
     - Use JavaScript libraries (e.g., GSAP) for scroll-triggered animations.
     - Add tooltips to social media icons on hover.

#### Success Criteria
- **Must-Have:** Navigation links smoothly scroll to the correct section. The form validates inputs and shows error messages for invalid fields.
- **Should-Have:** Projects load dynamically from JSON. The header stays visible while scrolling.
- **Can-Have:** Dark mode toggles correctly and remembers the user's preference. Animations and tooltips improve interactivity.
